> Cross-validated targeted minimum loss-based estimates of cross-validated area under the receiver operating characteristic curve

__Authors:__ [David Benkeser](https://www.benkeserstatistics.com/)

## Description

`cvtmleauc` is an R package for computing cross-validated targeted minimum loss-based estimates of cross-validated area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (cvAUC). This package is under active development. 

---

## Installation

<!-- For standard use, we recommend installing the package from
[CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/) via

```{r cran-installation, eval = FALSE}
install.packages("cvtmleAUC")
``` -->

You can install the current release of `cvtmleAUC` from GitHub via
[`devtools`](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rpackages/devtools/) with:

```{r gh-installation, eval = FALSE}
devtools::install_github("benkeser/cvtmleAUC")
```

<!--
To contribute, install the _development version_ from GitHub via
[`devtools`](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rpackages/devtools/):

```{r gh-develop-installation, eval = FALSE}
devtools::install_github("benkeser/cvtmleAUC", ref = "develop")
```
-->

## Issues

If you encounter any bugs or have any specific feature requests, please [file an
issue](https://github.com/benkeser/cvtmleAUC/issues).

## Example

This minimal example shows how to use `cvtmleAUC` to obtain cumulative incidence
estimates with a very simple, simulated data set.

```{r example, fig.align='center'}
# simulate data
set.seed(341796)
n <- 100
t_0 <- 10
W <- data.frame(W1 = runif(n), W2 = rbinom(n, 1, 0.5))
A <- rbinom(n, 1, 0.5)
T <- rgeom(n,plogis(-4 + W$W1 * W$W2 - A)) + 1
C <- rgeom(n, plogis(-6 + W$W1)) + 1
ftime <- pmin(T, C)
ftype <- as.numeric(ftime == T)

# load the package
library(cvtmleAUC)

# apply cvtmleAUC for estimation
fit <- cvtmleAUC(ftime = ftime, ftype = ftype,
                trt = A, adjustVars = W,
                glm.trt = "1",
                glm.ftime = "I(W1*W2) + trt + t",
                glm.ctime = "W1 + t", method = "hazard",
                t0 = t_0)

# extract cumulative incidence at each timepoint
tpfit <- timepoints(fit, times = seq_len(t_0))

# examine output object produced by the timepoints function
tpfit

# examine plot of cumulative incidences
plot(tpfit)
```
